Once upon a time there were two best friends, Oneeb and Patrick, they did everything together; they would hang out everyday after school and play videogames all day. Then one day, while Oneeb was on his way to meet Patrick at their secret jungle hideout a massive king cobra came falling from the sky and landed on his head. It wrapped itself around Oneeb rendering him unable to move, he yelled for help as loud as he could and Patrick, hearing a call for help, came rushing to the scene of the crime. As soon as the cobra saw him it slithered away into the jungle with Oneeb still in its clutches, Patrick tried to chase after the cobra but the it was too quick and disappeared into a dark ominous looking cave nearby.
Patrick then dicided to teleport to a different universe where the Oneeb killed the king cobra. Oneeb and Patrick then went to their secret jungle hideout. On the way to the jungle hideout, Patrick noticed there was very wrong with this universe.
Oddly enough, the universe that Patrick had teleported too didn't have king cobras. Patrick had discovered this by looking up king cobras on google and not being able to find any information about the animal. This left him puzzled. If there weren't any king cobras in this universe... then what had Oneeb killed? As he was walking with Oneeb, pondering these thoughts, his body froze. A thud echoed through the forest as Patrick's numbing body hit the floor. A brutal gash, dripping with blood, shot pain through his body. Oneeb slowly pulled his fangs out and slithered away.
